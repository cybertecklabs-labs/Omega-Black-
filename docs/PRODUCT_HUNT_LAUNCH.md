# 🚀 Product Hunt Launch Kit: OMEGA BLACK (ASCI)

**Goal:** Position OMEGA BLACK as the "Category King" of Autonomous & Sovereign Security.
**Target Rank:** #1 Product of the Day / Week.
**Strategy:** Shock & Awe. Positioning vs. Tools.

## 1. Title & Tagline (The Hook)

**Name:** OMEGA BLACK AI
**Tagline:** The All-in-One Autonomous Offensive Security & Compliance Infrastructure.
**Short Tagline (Mobile):** Autonomous Security & Compliance Infrastructure.

## 2. The Golden Description (SEO & conversion optimized)

**Problem:**
Traditional pentesting is a snapshot in time. Compliance (SOC2/ISO) is a manual nightmare. AI security tools are fragmented script-wrappers that lack context.

**Solution:**
OMEGA BLACK is the world's first **Autonomous Offensive Security Infrastructure (ASCI)**. It unifies Offensive AI, Compliance Intelligence, and Sovereign Reconnaissance into a single, self-healing Kubernetes architecture.

**Key Features:**
*   🦅 **Sovereign Intelligence:** 100% on-premise execution. No API leakage.
*   🧠 **Vector-Embedded Memory:** Remembers every asset, finding, and pattern forever.
*   🤖 **16-Agent Swarm:** Specialized AI agents for Recon, Exploitation, and Audit.
*   🛡️ **Compliance-as-Code:** Real-time mapping to SOC2, GDPR, and NIST-CSF.
*   ⚡ **AEVC Engine:** Autonomous Exploit Validation Cycle (safe proof-of-concepts).

**Deployment:**
Run it locally on Docker or deploy effectively to any K8s cluster.

## 3. The "Maker's Comment" (The Narrative Control)

*Post this immediately after launch. This establishes the "Why".*

**Header:** Stop buying tools. Start building infrastructure.

Hey Hunters! 👋

I'm the Principal Architect behind OMEGA BLACK.

For the last decade, I've watched the security industry sell "snapshots."
*   "Here's your PDF report from the pentest 3 months ago." (Outdated)
*   "Here's your Vanta checklist." (Manual)
*   "Here's a cool AI script on GitHub." (Ephemeral)

We realized that **Security isn't a task; it's a state of existence.**

That's why we built **OMEGA BLACK**. We moved the goalposts from "AI Hacking Tool" to **Autonomous Offensive Security Infrastructure (ASCI)**.

We combined:
1.  **CrowdStrike-style** telemetry.
2.  **Synack-style** offensive validation.
3.  **Vanta-style** compliance mapping.

Into ONE sovereign architecture that you own.

**Why Sovereign?**
Because your vulnerability data shouldn't be training someone else's model. OMEGA BLACK runs on your metal, in your cloud, for your eyes only.

We are releasing v2.1 today with the **Multi-Agent Swarm** and **Vector Memory** core.

I'll be in the comments all day answering technical questions about our K8s architecture and Agentic protocols.

Let's kill the snapshot.
Long live the heartbeat. 🖤

## 5. Potential FAQs (Pre-written authoritative answers)

**Q: How is this different from PentestGPT?**
A: PentestGPT is a tool you run in a terminal session. It relies on external LLMs and has no long-term memory. OMEGA BLACK is **Infrastructure**. It runs 24/7 on Kubernetes, remembers findings forever via Vector DB, and maps everything to compliance standards automatically.

**Q: Is this safe to run?**
A: Yes. The AEVC (Autonomous Exploit Validation Cycle) is engineered to perform *safe* interactions. It verifies vulnerabilities without destructive payloads (e.g., verifying SQLi logic without dropping tables).

**Q: Can I run this offline?**
A: 100%. That is the core of our "Sovereign" promise. You can perform air-gapped deployments using local LLMs (Llama 3 / Mistral) via Ollama.
